# Unified Assassin / Subtlety Rogue Macros

Here are some unified Assassin / Subtlty rogue macros for wow. I tried to set
these up so that similar keys have similar functionalty between the two
specs. I map my movement keys to ESDF so I have some more real estate for
key binds. I also bind some slots to buttons on my mouse.

I'm currently using the Icy Veins single target assassin build and the
Mythic+ AOE build. You will probably need to tweak the macros to suit
your specific needs.

# Installation

Find your World of Warcraft directory (probaby Program Files (x86)/World of Wacraft). Go down to \_retail\_/WTF/Account/youraccountname/server name/Character name.

Replace macros-cache.txt and macros-cache.old with the macros-cache.txt
file in this directory (Be sure to back up your old macros first in case
you lose something you needed.)

Start the game up, log into your rogue character and type /macro. You can
then drag the macros out to your bars.

Hope these help! Enjoy!
